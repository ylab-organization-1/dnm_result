## Service Overview

# Jquery_Browser_Use_20250730_155932 Dependency Detection Manual

This manual provides a comprehensive guide for detecting dependencies on the jQuery library in web applications. jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. This guide outlines unique identifiers, authentication patterns, HTTP headers, JavaScript patterns, CSS classes, WebSocket connection patterns, error response patterns, and example detection signatures.

## 1. Unique Identifiers

### URLs
- Main Website: `https://jquery.com/`
- Developer Documentation: `https://api.jquery.com/`
- [Add other relevant URLs]

### Common API Endpoints
- Information not applicable for jQuery as it is a JavaScript library, not a web service API.

### Function Names
- `$(selector).action()`
- `$.ajax()`
- [List service-specific functions]

## 2. Authentication Patterns

### API Key Authentication
- Information not applicable for jQuery as it is a JavaScript library, not a web service API.
- [Add other authentication methods]

## 3. Common HTTP Headers

- Information not applicable for jQuery as it is a JavaScript library, not a web service API.
- [Include both request and response headers]

## 4. JavaScript Patterns and Variable Names

### Common JavaScript Patterns

- AJAX call: `$.ajax({url: "example.com", method: "GET"});`
- [Add initialization patterns]

### Variable Names
- `jQuery`

- [List error patterns]

### HTTP Status Codes
- Information not applicable for jQuery as it is a JavaScript library, not a web service API.
- [List status codes]

## 8. Example Detection Signatures

### Regular Expression Pattern
```regex
/\$\((?:document|window)\)\.ready\(|\$\.[a-zA-Z]+\(|jQuery\.[a-zA-Z]+\(/g
```

### Key Indicators
- Use of `$` or `jQuery` for DOM manipulation
- Presence of `$(document).ready()`
- Use of `$.ajax()`
- [Order by reliability/uniqueness]

## Additional Notes

- jQuery is primarily used for DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX interactions.
- This report was generated using browser automation.
- Some information may be incomplete due to the nature of jQuery as a library rather than a service.
